## What this exercises

Statically-resolvable class methods + a free function with a branch. No dynamic dispatch; the call graph is exact (upper bound = lower bound).

## Ground truth

`ground_truth/{ast,cfg,callgraph,pdg}.json` — hand-derived per the procedure in
`../../methodology.md` (v0.1.0; nikic/PHP-Parser + the CFG/PDG extractor are pinned
there but not executed at build time, since PHP is not on the corpus-build host —
the JSON is the persisted output the `CMP-CP-06` harness compares against).
